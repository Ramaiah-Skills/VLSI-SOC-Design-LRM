# 3D Convolutional Neural Network with Max Pooling

## Project Overview

This project implements a **3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** designed for feature extraction and classification tasks. The primary goal is to process 3D input matrices through convolutional and max-pooling layers.

---

## Key Features

- **3D Convolutional Layer**: Processes 3D input matrices using configurable filters for feature extraction.
- **Max-Pooling Layer**: Reduces the size of the feature maps, enhancing computational efficiency.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Performs classification by calculating the dot product of pooled outputs with an input matrix.
- **Simulation Support**: Includes a testbench for simulating the CNN pipeline with Verilog.

## Methodology

The system operates in three stages:

1. **3D Convolution**
   - A 6x6x6 input matrix is processed using a 3x3x3 filter, generating feature maps.
   - Convolution is implemented as a hardware-optimized pipeline.

2. **Max-Pooling**
   - Reduces the size of the feature map, retaining the maximum values from 2x2x2 submatrices.
   - Outputs a smaller, representative feature map.

3. **Dot Product Calculation**
   - The pooled output is used for classification by calculating its dot product with a 4x24 matrix read from an external file (`row1_24.txt`).

## Input and Output

### Input:

1. A 6x6x6 image matrix.
2. A 3x3x3 convolution filter.
3. An 8x24 matrix stored in a `.txt` file (e.g., `row1_24.txt`).

### Output:

1. Feature maps after 3D convolution.
2. Reduced feature maps after max-pooling.
3. Final classification results from the dot product operation.

   - Hierarchical module integrating 3D convolution and max-pooling operations.

### 2. `cnn_3d_convolution.sv`
   - Performs 3D convolution to extract feature maps.
   - Outputs the convolution results (`conv_result`).

### 3. `cnn_3d_max_pooling.sv`
   - Performs 3D max-pooling on the convolution results to reduce spatial dimensions.
   - Outputs the pooling results (`pool_result`).

### 4. `tb_cnn_3d.sv`
   - Testbench simulating the CNN module, initializing the system, reading input matrix data, and performing operations:
     - **Input Data Initialization**: Loads a matrix from an external file (`row1_24.txt`).
     - **Matrix Multiplication**: Calculates the dot product of the pooled results with the input matrix (`row1_24.txt`).
     - **Results Display**: Prints the convolution and pooling results, as well as the matrix multiplication output.

## Module Parameters

## Input and Output Ports

### Inputs:
- **clk**: Clock signal for synchronous operation.
- **reset**: Resets the module to an initial state.

### Outputs:
- **pool_result**: Result of the max-pooling operation, a reduced-size feature map.
- **conv_result**: Intermediate convolution results.
- **done**: Indicates completion of both convolution and pooling operations.

## Implementation Details

### Instantiation of Submodules

1. **Convolution Module (`cnn_3d_convolution`)**:
   - Takes `IMG_SIZE`, `FILT_SIZE`, and `NUM_FILTERS` as parameters.
   - Outputs a feature map (`conv_result`) of size `(IMG_SIZE - FILT_SIZE + 1)³ * NUM_FILTERS`.
   - Sets the `conv_done` flag when the operation completes.

2. **Max-Pooling Module (`cnn_3d_max_pooling`)**:
   - Takes adjusted image size `(IMG_SIZE - FILT_SIZE + 1)` and `NUM_FILTERS`.
   - Outputs the reduced feature map (`pool_result`) after max-pooling.
   - Sets the `pool_done` flag when the operation completes.

### Done Flag Logic

- Combines `conv_done` and `pool_done` flags.
- Sets the `done` output to 1 only when both convolution and pooling operations complete.

### Behavior

#### Reset Behavior
- On reset, the `done` signal is cleared (0).

#### Sequential Processing
1. The convolution module (`cnn_3d_convolution`) processes the input matrix and sets the `conv_done` flag.
2. The max-pooling module (`cnn_3d_max_pooling`) processes the `conv_result` and sets the `pool_done` flag.
3. Once both flags are set, the `done` signal indicates completion.

## Results

1. **Input Image Matrix**: A 6x6x6 image matrix.
2. **Feature Map**: Extracted after applying the 3x3x3 convolution filter.
3. **Pooled Output**: Reduced representation after max-pooling.
4. **Dot Product Result**: Classification output (8x1) based on the dot product with the 8x24 matrix.
